#Dialog-MLP Chatbot Project
##Overview
Welcome to the Dialog-MLP Chatbot project! This initiative employs a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) to comprehend and generate responses based on patterns learned from input-output sequences. Primarily designed for chat settings, the MLP is trained on self-collected data to offer contextually relevant and engaging interactions.

##Key Features
**MLP Training**: The project harnesses the power of Multi-layer Perceptron, a neural network model, to learn and understand dialogue patterns.

**Data Collection**: We've curated a dataset to train the MLP, ensuring diverse and contextually rich input-output sequences for an enhanced chatbot experience.

**Contextual Responses**: The MLP's training enables it to provide contextually relevant responses, making the chatbot more conversational and engaging.

##Contributing
Contributions are encouraged! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to enhance the project, improve dialogue patterns, or add features to the chatbot.
